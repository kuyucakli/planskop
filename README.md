I am using auth.js (next-auth v5 beta ) with keycloak provider for authentication.

For the job que and sending email reminders I've used upstash account with redis. On the client side bullmq, ioredis was used.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
