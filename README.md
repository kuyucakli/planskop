# Planskop

**Planskop** is a small, focused app for planning your day around a few meaningful habits or actions. It’s built for personal use — simple enough to stay out of your way, but structured enough to help you follow through.

## What It Does

- 🗓️ Plan your day using short, time-based action slots
- 🔁 Define habits that repeat (e.g. every weekday, or every Monday)
- 🌍 Timezone-aware — reminders adjust to your local time
- ✅ Validates overlapping or duplicate actions
- 🙋‍♀️ User login via [Clerk.js](https://clerk.dev)
- 🖼️ Media uploads (e.g. avatars, icons) via [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- 💾 Data stored per user in a [Neon](https://neon.tech/) PostgreSQL database
